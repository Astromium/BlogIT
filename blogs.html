            <b>Javascript is weird</b>. Don’t believe me? Try converting an
            array of strings into integers using map and parseInt. Fire up your
            console (F12 on Chrome), paste in the following, and press enter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Convinsed now ? So lets try and analyse this step by step.</p>
          <h1>parseInt( ) :</h1>
          <p>
            <b>ParseInt</b> takes two arguments: <i>string</i> and <i>radix</i>.
            If the radix provided is falsy, then by default, radix is set to 10.
          </p>
          <div class="snippet">
            <p>parseInt('11'); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; => 11</p>
            <p>parseInt('11', 2); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=> 3</p>
            <p>parseInt('11', 16); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=> 17</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              parseInt('11', undefined); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; => 11 (radix is
              falsy)
            </p>
            <p>parseInt('11', 0); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=> 11 (radix is falsy)</p>
          </div>
          <h1>map( ) :</h1>
          <p>
            We’re almost there!
            <br />
            Map is a method in the Array prototype that returns a new array of
            the results of passing each element of the original array into a
            function. For example, the following code multiplies each element in
            the array by 3:
          </p>
          <div class="img">
            <img src="map-snippet.png" alt="" height="250px" width="600px" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Now, let’s say I want to log each element using <b>map( )</b> (with
            no return statements). I should be able to pass
            <b>console.log</b> as an argument into map( )… right?
            <br />
            <b>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(console.log)</b>
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="map-log.png" alt="" width="600px" height="300px" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Something very strange is going on. Instead of logging just the
            value, each <b>console.log</b> call also logged the index and full
            array.
            <br />
            When a function is passed into <b>map( )</b>, for each iteration,
            three arguments are passed into the function: <b>currentValue</b>,
            <b>currentIndex</b>, and the <b>full array</b>. That is why three
            entries are logged for each iteration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>We now have all the pieces we need to solve this mystery.</p>
          <h1>Bringing it all together :</h1>
          <p>Now let's run our example step by step</p>
          <div class="snippet">
            <p>['1', '7', '11'].map(parseInt) &nbsp;&nbsp; => [1, NaN, 3]</p>
            <p>// First Iteration</p>
            <p>parseInt('1', 0, ['1', '7', '11']); &nbsp; => 1</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Since 0 is falsy, the radix is set to the default value 10.
            <b>parseInt( )</b> only takes two arguments, so the third argument
            ['1', '7', '11'] is ignored. The string '1' in radix 10 refers to
            the number 1.
          </p>
          <div class="snippet">
            <p>// Second Iteration</p>
            <p>parseInt('7', 1, ['1', '7', '11'] &nbsp;&nbsp; => NaN)</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In a radix 1 system, the symbol <b>'7'</b> does not exist. As with
            the first iteration, the last argument is ignored. So,
            <b>parseInt( )</b> returns <b>NaN</b>.
          </p>
          <div class="snippet">
            <p>// Third iteration</p>
            <p>parseInt('11', 2, ['1', '7', '11'] &nbsp;&nbsp; => 3)</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In a radix <b>2</b> (binary) system, the symbol <b>'11'</b> refers
            to the number <b>3</b>. The last argument is ignored.
          </p>

            My Favourite vscode setup (extensions, themes, tip & tricks) :
          </h1>
          <p>
            So I tried a lot of text editors like ATOM, SUBLIME TEXT, NOTEPAD++
            and then I fell in love of <b>Visual Studio Code</b> which is a free
            text editor from <b>Microsoft</b> and here is some of the reasons
            why
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              vs code feels fast. It is tough to get vs code to slow down.
              Usually, it is not the fault of vs code but a poorly implemented
              extension.
            </li>
            <li>
              File search is super fast. It feels instant. Like there is no wait
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is lightweight but also has most of the things you need
              pre-installed. Search files, debugging, basic git GUI.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nice theme support and customization support. You can pretty much
              change everything in vs code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Excellent extensions! Think of an extension you need? Yeah vs code
              has that!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now lets move on to my favorite extensions and themes</p>
          <h1>Extensions :</h1>
          <ul class="ext-list">

                with live browser reload.

          <p>
            What an <b>API</b> you say ? Here is a simple explanation for tech
            and non-tech people
          </p>
          <h1>Ordering Food</h1>
          <p>
            You’re home, you’re hungry, you’re lazy. Time to order some food.
          </p>
          <p>
            You decide to order from Jack’s Burgers, so you look through their
            menu to see the options, then request a specific dish by placing an
            order. The order is received at Jack’s Burgers, passed along to the
            kitchen, and a series of steps are performed to create the dish.
            That dish is delivered to you and is quickly devoured.
          </p>
          <h1>So What is an API? It’s like a Menu ?</h1>
          <p>
            In the above analogy, you’re a program and the restaurants are
            programs that you want to interact with. To receive what you want
            (food) from the other program (restaurant), you need to make a
            request (place an order) in a specific way (defined by the menu). If
            you try to request in the wrong way, you won’t get what you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs are like menus. Menus define a list of dishes and, when someone
            orders one of those dishes, the restaurant does a bunch of stuff and
            then sends the requested dish back. APIs define a list of commands
            and, when a program uses one of those commands, the other program
            does a bunch of stuff and then sends back what was requested by that
            command (usually some kind of data).
          </p>
          <div class="img1"><img src="api-illus.png" alt="" /></div>

          <p>
            So APIs define a list of commands as well as the necessary format of
            those commands. When a company releases an API for their software,
            it means that they’ve basically told everyone: here is what you can
            get from our program and here is exactly how you have to ask to get
            it.
